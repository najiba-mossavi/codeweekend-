			In 2017, I was granted a full scholarship to pursue a degree in India. For the first time, I stepped out and travelled miles away from my family for an achievement I was determined to achieve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Studying in India exposed me to a whole new world. From 21st century technology to giant businesses with thousands of employees. I was amazed by how many business opportunities were they creating and how a huge population such as India is being put into work to keep the economy running.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was inspiring me to constantly keep searching and learning about the different business models in India, and building up on my skills and knowledge, hoping to be able to help businesses create jobs when I return to Afghanistan.
		</p>
			<p>
				Besides the college academics, I was actively involved in extra-curricular activities. I was a volunteer member of the Federation of International Students – Mysore (FISA-M), where I was helping the new international female students with their admissions, exams and just being around them when they were feeling home-sick. We were organizing many events and activities to have the international students engaged and keeping them active.
			</p>
		<p>
			I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration (BBA) from the University of Mysore, India. Three years of study had challenges and difficult times. But it was life changing. Living away from home taught me to be independent and more responsible. It was a great journey which I had dreamed about and worked so hard for, and I am very grateful and proud of it.
